# osbuild-gitops
This is a simple example demonstrating building bootable OS images with osbuild. Repo currently contains a osbuild blueprint template to build a RHEL9 base bootable system image for demonstration purposes. Keep in mind this is just an example to demonstrate use of best practices and its intended to be a reference for infrastructure teams.
